Flutter Learning Path
This project contains the source code and resources for my Flutter learning path, which is a series of tutorials and projects that I followed to learn how to build cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and Dart.

What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is fast, expressive, and easy to learn. Flutter also provides a rich set of widgets, animations, and tools that make UI development a breeze.

Why Flutter?
I chose Flutter as my learning path because I wanted to:

Learn a modern and powerful UI framework that can run on multiple platforms
Develop fast and responsive apps with hot reload and hot restart
Write clean and maintainable code with stateful hot reload and declarative UI
Create stunning and interactive UIs with built-in widgets and animations
Access native features and services using platform channels and plugins
Test and debug my apps with Flutter tools and extensions
How to use this project?
This project is organized into folders that correspond to different topics and levels of difficulty. Each folder contains a README file that explains the topic, the learning objectives, the resources, and the steps to run the code. The folders are:

Introduction: This folder contains the basic setup and installation instructions for Flutter and Dart, as well as some introductory tutorials on how to create your first Flutter app, how to use widgets, how to handle user input, how to navigate between screens, and how to use themes and styles.
Intermediate: This folder contains more advanced topics such as state management, networking, local storage, authentication, animations, custom widgets, internationalization, accessibility, testing, and debugging.
Advanced: This folder contains some challenging projects that showcase the full potential of Flutter, such as a chat app, a news app, a music player app, a weather app, a todo app, a quiz app, and a e-commerce app.
To use this project, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. You can follow the installation guide [here]. You also need to have an IDE or editor of your choice, such as VS Code or Android Studio. You can find the recommended editor plugins [here].

To run the code in each folder, you need to open the terminal or command prompt in that folder and run the following commands:

# To get the dependencies
flutter pub get

# To run the app on a connected device or emulator
flutter run

You can also use the Flutter tools or extensions in your editor to run or debug the app.
